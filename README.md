# save-vocabulary-chrome-extension
Google chrome extension adding a right click menu option to save vocabulary words found online, with their definitions. 

The goal is to make learning vocabulary words easier by making saving new words to a list easier. This list can be reviewed to re-inforce the discovery of new words. 

A use case would be reading a newspaper article online, not knowing a word, and saving it. Then at the end of the day, reviewing the list of words discovered during the day.

The exact way this will work is not certain yet. For now my plan is to automatically add words to Google drive with their definition, or to add words through an API to my other project (brute-gender-web).
